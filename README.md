*SortZilla UI*

# Technologies
- All written using **C#**
- **Threading** done with **BackgroundWorker** in order to avoid freezing UI during sorting operation
- UI designed in **WPF/XAML**
# Functionalities
- The software sorts a very large data set of different images (using their assigned labels/tags) to different folders, to substantially decrease the time that would have been required to manually sort the images
- Output would be used for a document classifier using image processing to identify the type of a scanned document

## Important
- Due to the very large image data set required to run the algorithm (30+GB), which is not uploaded, it is not possible to run the application
